## An app to find basketball players at various parks

## Inspiration
Growing up, I would go to outdoor parks to play basketball with my friends and sometimes, we would see other players out on the courts but at other times, the courts would be empty. A lot of the times we would find ourselves with an odd number of players or not enough to get a full 5 on 5 going which is what made me think about creating this app! 

### Technologies used: React, Node, Express, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage), Mapbox API, Yelp API
